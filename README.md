VEHICLE_CONTROL_SUIT
This project simulates vehicle data, predicts fuel levels using a machine learning model, controls vehicle systems such as throttle, and stores and visualizes data with InfluxDB and Grafana. It also provides a FastAPI interface for interaction.

Project Structure
main.py: FastAPI web server that handles the REST API for the system.
model.py: Contains the neural network model for fuel level prediction.
train_rf_model.py: Trains a Random Forest model using synthetic data.
train_model.py: Trains a neural network model using vehicle data.
data_generator.py: Generates synthetic vehicle data using the VehicleSimulator class.
vehicle_data.csv: Sample dataset generated from the vehicle simulator.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies for the project.
Dockerfile: Docker configuration for containerizing the application.
pid_controller.py: Implements a PID controller for throttle regulation.

Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd VEHICLE_CONTROL_SUIT

2. Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train the models:
To train the Random Forest model, run:

python train_rf_model.py
To train the neural network model using vehicle_data.csv, run:

python train_model.py
5. Run the FastAPI web server:

uvicorn main:app --reload
The web interface will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Docker Setup
You can also run the project using Docker. Here are the steps:

1. Build the Docker image:

docker build -t VEHICLE_CONTROL_SUIT .
2. Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 VEHICLE_CONTROL_SUIT
The FastAPI application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

Requirements
Python 3.11+
InfluxDB and Grafana for data visualization (optional for local setup).
Docker (optional for containerization).

Instructions to Use:

Clone the repository:
Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL when you copy the README.md.

Install dependencies:
Install the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Training:
Use train_rf_model.py to generate synthetic data and train a Random Forest model.
Use train_model.py to train the neural network model with the generated data.

Docker Usage:
Build and run the Docker container to easily deploy the application in a containerized environment.

Further Improvements

Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Add a more detailed evaluation step for both models (Random Forest and Neural Network).
Use grid search or randomized search to find optimal hyperparameters for both models.

Model Persistence and Versioning:
Implement model versioning and automatic retraining using new data.

Data Preprocessing Enhancements:
Add additional features (e.g., time-based features, interaction terms) and outlier detection.
Use data augmentation techniques like SMOTE for class balance.

API Enhancements:
Add authentication (OAuth2, JWT) for secured endpoints.
Use background tasks for non-blocking operations.

Data Storage and Retrieval:
Integrate a database like PostgreSQL for scalable data management.
Use InfluxDB for time-series data storage and visualization.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Set up automated tests and CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment.

Real-time Monitoring and Logging:
Set up monitoring tools like Grafana and logging frameworks for system health tracking.

Model Explainability:
Use SHAP or LIME for explaining the model's predictions.

Frontend/UI Enhancements:
Build a dashboard or UI for better data visualization and interaction.

Cloud Deployment:
Deploy the application to cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Security:
Implement encryption for sensitive data and perform regular security audits.

Performance Optimization:
Optimize the models using techniques like pruning and quantization for faster inference.
Improve API performance by implementing caching and asynchronous processing.
